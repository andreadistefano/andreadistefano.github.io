My name is Andrea, I live in Italy, and I've been using computers and living on the internet since the late 90s/early 00's (thanks dad!). \
In the past 5 years I got my Master's Degree in Computer Science, then moved to a failed PhD in Operations Research/Combinatorial Optimization, and now I'm a Software/DevOps Engineer.

On the coding side, I mainly work in the backend side using **C#/.NET** and/or **Python**. I'm also interested in **Go**, and I'd like to have the chance to use it in a future project.

On the DevOps side, I love automation and observability. I've worked with **Jenkins** and **GitLab CI/CD**, and I'm currently working with **GitHub Actions**. I'm also working big time on **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, and **Helm**. I've been playing with **Terraform**, but I'm not using it in my current job. I have experience with monitoring tools and like **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, and the **OpenTelemetry** ecosystem.

I know and love **Windows** and **Linux**, and I know my way around **PowerShell** and **Bash**.
